# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-08-19

The first bound volume. Octavo is an open-source, self-hosted documentation
platform: write like Notion, publish like a book, deploy in one container.

### Highlights

- **Editor**: BlockNote block editor — slash commands, drag handles, tables,
  checklists, images (paste screenshots directly), files, video. Autosave
  with draft → publish flow; published URLs freeze so links never break.
- **Reader**: book-grade published pages — chapter numbering, drop caps,
  numbered space TOC with dotted leaders, "on this page" rail with
  scroll-spy, previous/next page turns, end-of-chapter asterism.
- **Code**: server-side Shiki highlighting for every language, language
  label, copy button, cached rendering.
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid rendering from code blocks (theme-aware); whiteboard
  with Excalidraw (sketch) and draw.io (precise) tabs.
- **Video**: uploads with HTTP range streaming (seekable), plus YouTube and
  Vimeo embeds rendered privacy-friendly.
- **Templates**: 13 space templates — wiki, cookbook, notebook, product
  docs, SRE runbooks, DevOps playbook, API reference, data science, network
  engineering, AI engineering, biological compute, ADRs.
- **Search**: SQLite FTS5 with BM25 ranking, prefix matching, highlighted
  snippets, cmd+K everywhere; private content never appears in anonymous
  search.
- **Spaces**: private by default, public per space; sealed-space messaging;
  infinite page nesting.
- **No lock-in**: export any page as Markdown or PDF (print engine, keeps
  the typography), any table as CSV, any space as a zip of Markdown plus a
  lossless manifest; import Octavo zips, Markdown folders, or single files.
- **Theming**: permanent Paper & Ink default (light + dark), five preset
  palettes, and hidden seasonal themes (Oct–Jan) with hand-drawn SVG
  decorations and rare flybys.
- **Operations**: single Docker container, single SQLite file, local
  accounts with first-run setup, zero external services. `npm test` unit
  suite and a load-test harness (`npm run loadtest`); v0.1.0 baseline:
  300–1,800 req/s per route at p99 < 80 ms on a laptop, zero errors.

### Security

- scrypt password hashing, httpOnly sessions, HTML-escaped search snippets,
  ranged file serving with sniffing protection, SVG served as attachment,
  upload extension allowlist, `npm audit` clean (0 vulnerabilities).
